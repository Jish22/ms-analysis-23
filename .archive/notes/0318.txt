1)
    - senseplit - python package to split into test and train data
    - link: https://github.com/mmalekzadeh/motion-sense/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file  
    - https://github.com/mmalekzadeh/sensplit2) 
    - developed rolling window technique to use on the data
        - creates segments with specified step and 
    - made rnn  (3layer LSTM using tensofrflow) for padded and normal data - 50% accuracy
    - look up papers for triaxial accelerometer data
    - with some tuning, we can turn up accuracy

3)
    - look at optimizing window and step sizes
    - come up for a list for derived metric
    - FFT
    - Wavelet transform
